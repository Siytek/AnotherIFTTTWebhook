# AnotherIFTTTWebhook Trigger

After I discovered the IFTTT webhook library in Arduino has been depriciated, I found some great code by Neil Webber that can be used to send a webhook to IFTTT.

His original code is here: https://gist.github.com/outofmbufs/d6ced37b49a484c495f0

# How to use:
1. Place AnotherIFTTTWebhook.h in the same directory as your Arduino .ino project file.
2. Add #include "AnotherIFTTTWebhook.h" to your main project file
3. Send webhook by adding the function send_webhook(EVENT, KEY, Value1, Value2, Value3) to your main project file.
